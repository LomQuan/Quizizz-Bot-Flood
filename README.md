# Quizizz Bot Flood
A Quizizz bot flood "hack". Tested only on windows so far. This was developed for educational and experimental reasons only, if you want to use it for more that is your own choice. I am not responsible for what you do with this project in any way.

# How To Use
To use you must download one of the two files, either threaded or not.
[Threaded is in beta and may crash or close for no reason, non-threaded is recommended.]


After downloading the file of your choice you must get the latest edge or chrome web driver, links below:

[Edge WebDriver Download](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

[Chrome WebDriver Download](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

You must move the web driver exe file into the same folder as the python file, You also need to update the name of the driver inside the python file like so:
```
webdriver_location="<exe_file_name_here>"
```

Upon Startup you will also need to pick what browser you want to use. This should work without issues but it might not.

# If There Are Still Issues
If there are still issues after fixing the file to your liking then I would try the following things. (You can try installing the packages manually but if they aren't found they will be auto installed upon running either python file.)

1. If you are using msedge try installing the required library: `pip install msedge-selenium-tools`
2. If you haven't installed selenium: `pip install selenium`
3. If you haven't installed python: [Python Download 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/)
4. If it still doesn't work open an issue on GitHub with as much information as you can provide or join my support discord server [Here](https://discord.gg/RnbxGu6jYt). Expect an answer or response within 24 hours.

# If You Want To Copy
I'm not going to be upset if you copy my code, its open source for a reason. Just give credit where its desired. If you want to work together on a project feel free to reach out to me. I'm often bored and looking for a project. Also, please don't copy for no reason, at least make your own changes.
